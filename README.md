# Keep It Fit

[Keep It Fit](https://newhorizonweb.github.io/keepitfit/) - Your ultimate app for accessing comprehensive nutritional data.

Based on the Nutritionix API, Keep It Fit boasts information about a wide range of items - from apples and carrots to pierogi and cheesecakes!

## Landing Page

You will be greeted by a slick, modern landing page, with a friendly and minimalist UI.

The search bar can be used to find your favorite type of melon - with the help of the auto-complete hint list!

Everything is carefully designed, so that your experience is as seamless as possible.

## Details Page

This is where the magic happens!
There are a lot of features, going far beyond just plain "nutrition facts" tables.
Let's go through them to better understand the app's UI, shall we?

Oh, and look! There is a search bar on this page too!
If you find the current search boring, you can simply find something fancier.

### Navigation

What is life without a sense of direction?
Navigation is here to help!

You can quickly scroll through the page and see which section you are currently on.

If you don't want to use your browser's default language, you can switch it to something else (the "globe" button).

#### Body Metrics

Numbers, numbers everywhere!
Here, you can input your body metrics, such as your height, weight, activity level, and so on.

You can choose the units - metric (basically, all of the world minus the USA) or imperial (USA).
Everything will be used to calculate your AMR (Active Metabolic Rate) and BMI (Body Mass Index).

Based on those values, you can individualize the nutrition tables.
For example, the items you search for will display the recommended daily value (% DV) adjusted for your needs.
Remember, it's not 100% accurate, but it can give you a general idea of how the nutrient fits into your daily needs.

P.S. Don't worry!
Everything is stored locally in your browser's storage, so only you will know if you gained some belly fat recently :)

#### Bookmark & Favorite Items

We all do have our favorites, don't we?
Keep It Fit makes it easier to save your favorite searches and find them later in your personally crafted list.

Don't like brown rice anymore?
Remove it from the list and move on to quinoa!

#### PDF

Want to share your latest discovery?
Or maybe you have some issues with your internet connection and want to make sure your favorite kind of potatoes are safe with you?

Whatever the case, you can simply download the page in a PDF format or just print it out!

### Nutrition Facts (Macronutrients Table)

Ahhh, data...
Even though not everyone enjoys looking at those tables, we sure do love it when the cheese we're craving has far fewer calories than we thought!

However, if you still find the macros to be too much for your liking, you can always adjust the serving size.
Use the input field to enter the weight in grams, and the table will automatically calculate everything!

### Pie Charts

Now, that's more like it!
Check out how the searched item's macros compare to one another.
It's always easier to visualize something with colors and ratios.

Curious what percentage of the item's weight is water, or if the item is well-suited for your low-carb diet?
See at a glance the weight & calorie ratios to find out!

### Micronutrients Table

You can think of it as an extension of the macronutrients table.
Here, you will find some useful info about vitamins and minerals.

If you are looking for more iron or potassium in your diet, you just hit the bullseye!

### Diet Lables

Last but not least - the diet labels, just so you get to know the food you are about to eat a little bit better.
It's a simple way to check the item's properties, if it suits your diet.
